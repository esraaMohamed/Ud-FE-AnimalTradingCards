			<p>A kitten is a juvenile cat. After being born, kittens are totally
				dependent on their mother for survival and they do not normally open
				their eyes until after seven to ten days. After about two weeks,
				kittens quickly develop and begin to explore the world outside the nest.
				After a further three to four weeks, they begin to eat solid food and
				grow adult teeth. Domestic kittens are highly social animals and
				usually enjoy human companionship.</p>
